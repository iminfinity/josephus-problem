# Josephus Problem
__According to legend, the first-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus was about to be captured along with a band of 40 compatriots by Roman soldiers during the Jewish-Roman War. The Jewish soldiers decided that they preferred suicide to being captured and devised a plan for their demise. They were to form a circle and kill every third soldier until they were all dead. Josephus and one other decided they wanted no part of this and quickly calculated where they needed to place themselves so they would be the last survivors. Where do Josephus and his friend sit in order to survive__
